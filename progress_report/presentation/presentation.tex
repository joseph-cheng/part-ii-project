  \frametitle{Project Overview}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Identify performer of a piano piece based on qualities of the audio signal
    \item
      Calculate metrics of a signal, and compare to metrics of other signals to make a decision

    \item
      Goal of project is comparing metrics and under what conditions they work/fail


  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}

    \item
      Project slightly behind schedule

      \begin{itemize}

      \item
        All 5 metric calculators and similarity calculators are implemented

      \item
        Data synthesis engine has been completed, and real-world data collection is also completed
            
      \end{itemize}

    \item
      No work on extensions has been completed


  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Key Work Remaining}

  \begin{itemize}

    \item
      Concretise evaluation methods, and subsequently evaluate the system

    \item
      Finish writing dissertation (Preparation chapter onwards)

    \item
      Implement variation in input data for evaluation (e.g. addition of noise)
