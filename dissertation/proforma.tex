  \section*{Original Aims of the Project}

  The original aims of the project were to implement a system that was intended to be able to identify who the performer of a piece of piano music was, based on the audio signal of that performance and of previous performances of the same piece. This system would use 5 metrics, and the project's aim was to evaluate how useful each of these 5 metrics are, and under what conditions they are useful.

  \section*{Work Completed}
  TODO: COMPLETE WHEN DONE

  I implemented each of the initially proposed metrics: tempo variation over time, dynamics over time, chroma vector extraction, note offsets, and timbre extraction. I also implemented a data synthesis module that allowed me to synthesise piano data to test each of these metrics on before I had begun real-world data collection. 

  \section*{Special Difficulties}
  None.
